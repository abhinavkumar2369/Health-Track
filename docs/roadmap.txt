Advanced Features You Could Add

To take your project from good to excellent, here are extra features you can consider:

1. Disease Heatmap Visualization
	Show trends of diseases by region (using charts/maps).
	Helps in outbreak monitoring (like dengue, flu, etc.).


2. Voice Assistant for Patients
	Patients can ask “What’s my next appointment?” or “Show my health history” using speech.
	Use a speech-to-text + NLP integration.


3. Blockchain for EHR Security (Optional, advanced)
	Store a hash of medical records on blockchain for tamper-proof verification.
	Data Privacy & Consent Management

4. Patients can control what parts of their data doctors/insurance can access.
	Good to demonstrate GDPR/ HIPAA-inspired compliance.


5. Wearable/IoT Device Integration
	Collect real-time health data (heart rate, steps, sleep) from smart devices.
	Sync into the health dashboard.


6. AI Chatbot for Health Queries
	Patients can ask common questions about symptoms, medicine instructions, or diet plans.
	Predictive Analytics for Hospitals
	Admin dashboard can show trends like “expected patient inflow next month,” or “bed occupancy prediction.”
